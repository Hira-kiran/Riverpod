***************** RiverPod *************************

1. Firstly we need to install package that is flutter_riverpod. We have 3 packages for riverpod that are 
riverpod (this is for dart), flutter_riverpod(for flutter), hooks_riverpod(for flutter hook).
2. We define riverpod globally then give the state in runApp() using ProviderScope.
3. In riverpod we are not use stateless and statefull widget, in the place of stateless we use consumerWidget 


***************** Providers in riverod ****************

1. *Provider* (isy hm state dyty hyn and then down the tree khin py b access kr skty hyn, just read only provider, data change ni hota, widget re-build nhi hota)

2. *State Provider* (isy hm simple state dyty hyn, complex nhi. and then down the tree khin py b access kr skty hyn, read and write provider, data change hota h, widget re-build hota h)
3. *Future Provider* (equivalent to provider but for asynchronous code, performing and caching asyncronous operation such as network request, nicely handling errors , loading state of asyncrounous data )
4. *Stream Provider* (similar to future provider but for streams instead of future, rebuilding another provider every few seconds, listing to firebase or web sockets)
5. *State Notifier Provider* (used to listen and expose a state notifier, work on immutable state which can change over time)
6. *Change Notifier Provider* (riverpod prevent to use it in riverpod statemanagement, supporting mutable states)


******** Provider vs Riverpod ***********
          Pros of riverpod over provider
.. Compile safe (NO providerNotFound exception anymore)
.. Does not depend on widget tree 
.. support multiple providers at the same time 


*********** Motifiers *******************
Use to add extra functionalities in provider
There are two modifiers in riverpod

1) .autoDispose modifier
2) .Family modifier

1) .autoDispose modifier
Use to destroy the state of provider when it is no longer used. Remove caching
Use to reset the state when the user leaves the screen and re-enter it.
When using firebase to close the connection and avoid unnessessory cost.

2) .Family modifier
used to get a unique provider based on external parameter

we use both modifier at one time
